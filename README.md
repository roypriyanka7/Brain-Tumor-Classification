# Brain-Tumor-Classification

<h3>
This repository contains the data, coding files and other resources to replicate the findings of our paper titled "An Ensemble Approach for Advanced Brain Tumor Classification Applying Dual-GAN Mechanism and Feature Extraction Techniques over Highly Imbalanced Data". The repository will be made publicly accessible once our manuscript has been officially published by PLoS One.
